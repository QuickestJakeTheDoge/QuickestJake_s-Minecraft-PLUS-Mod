# MATCH_VERSION means that your mod will cause a red X if the versions on client and server differ. This is the default behaviour and should be what you choose if you have server and client elements to your mod.
# IGNORE_SERVER_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the server but not on the client. This is what you should use if you're a server only mod.
# IGNORE_ALL_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the client or the server. This is a special case and should only be used if your mod has no server component.
# NONE means that no display test is set on your mod. You need to do this yourself, see IExtensionPoint.DisplayTest for more information. You can define any scheme you wish with this value.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: this is NOT an instruction as to which environments (CLIENT or DEDICATED SERVER) your mod loads on. Your mod should load (and maybe do nothing!) whereever it finds itself.

One day, I was thinking about how there's not much to do after you beat the Ender Dragon.

I mean sure, you get the elytra, you can build more and do more exploration, but as far as bosses go, there's only the Wither, but that's assuming you havent already done that

I then went to CurseForge to see if there were any mods that added post-Ender Dragon stuff, and to my surprise, there weren't many.

That's why I made this mod!

In this mod, I've added some post-Ender Dragon Bosses, Mobs, Events, ect.

I've also added a few pre-Ender Dragon things that I think should have been in the game already along with easter eggs, and maybe some hidden lore (Maybe MatPat will do a theory lol)

I've even added some story to it, but not to much to the point where it's a completely different game, and yes, there is technically a "final boss," but you don't have fight all of the bosses in one order, as there are optional bosses.

(Just a quick warning, towards the end, end as in end of the game, it does get a bit spooky, but don't worry, it's not worse than disc 11, right?)

Also, I have a YouTube channel, so if you like this mod, why don't you consider subscribing? It's completely free, and if you don't like me, you can always change your mind later

So what are you still doing here? Get to punching trees!
